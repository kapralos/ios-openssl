Build script for OpenSSL 1.0.1e for iOS.

It creates multi-architecture static lib with support for armv7, armv7s and
i386 (for running in the simulator).

Works on:

 * MacOS X 10.9.0
 * Xcode 5.0
 * iOS SDK 7.0

How to use:

 * cd /path/to/build.sh
 * chmod +x build.sh
 * ./build.sh

After that, youâ€™ll get 2 dirs:

 * ./lib/ - contain libssl.a and libcrypto.a
 * ./include/ - contain openssl headers

NOTE: build procedure may take several minutes

Important: Support for ARMv6 has been removed because Xcode 4.5 does not support
that architecture anymore. This means that these libraries cannot be used on the
iPhone 3G or older. File an issue if that is a really big deal for you and I will
try to work around that Xcode limitation.

Building is done by invoking the build.sh script:

 ./build.sh

It will take about 5 minutes on a modern Mac. The result of the build can be found at:

 lib/ - will contain libssl.a and libcrypto.a
 include/ - will contain all OpenSSL headers


The Example directory contains a little sample app. It calculates a SHA1 digest using
the OpenSSL API.


IMPORTANT

I included pre-compiled binaries of the openssl libraries in this project mostly for my
own convenience. But you should really not trust me and do two things:

 1) Verify that the openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz file is authentic by comparing it's SHA1
    hash to the one found on http://www.openssl.org/source/ You can do this with
    the 'openssl sha1 openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz' command.
 2) Compile your own version of the library as explained above
