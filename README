Build script for OpenSSL 1.0.1e for iOS.

It creates multi-architecture static lib with support for armv7, armv7s, arm64 and
i386 (for running in the simulator).

Works on:

 * MacOS X 10.9.0
 * Xcode 5.0
 * iOS SDK 7.0

How to use:

 * cd /path/to/build.sh
 * chmod +x build.sh
 * ./build.sh

After that, youâ€™ll get 2 dirs:

 * ./lib/ - contain libssl.a and libcrypto.a
 * ./include/ - contain openssl headers

NOTE: build procedure may take several minutes


The Example directory contains a little sample app. It calculates a SHA1 digest using
the OpenSSL API.


IMPORTANT

I included pre-compiled binaries of the openssl libraries in this project mostly for my
own convenience. But you should really not trust me and do two things:

 1) Verify that the openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz file is authentic by comparing it's SHA1
    hash to the one found on http://www.openssl.org/source/ You can do this with
    the 'openssl sha1 openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz' command.
 2) Compile your own version of the library as explained above
